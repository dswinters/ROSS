* petersburg_2017_apr notes
Test deployments in Petersburg, getting ready for the May cruise on
the Stellar.

This is the first set of ROSS data using the Sentinel-V ADCP.

** Status summary
Logged Sentinel V ADCP data can be parsed in single- and dual-profile
mode. There is a problem with the PAVS data logging. This is likely an
issue with hardware between the ADCP and the ABox, since the logging
software is unchanged, and past data loaded directly from the PAVS can
be parsed.

TODO: Test new ADCP logging timestamp method.
