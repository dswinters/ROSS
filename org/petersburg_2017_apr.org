Test deployments in Petersburg, getting ready for the May cruise on
the Stellar.

This is the first set of ROSS data using the Sentinel-V ADCP.

** Status summary
Logged Sentinel V ADCP data can be parsed in single- and dual-profile
mode. There is a problem with the PAVS data logging. This is likely an
issue with hardware between the ADCP and the ABox, since the logging
software is the same on all ABoxes, and past data loaded directly from
the PAVS can be parsed. It's possible that the PAVS is damaged and
has intermittent data transmission errors.

For the PAVS deployment during the pelican trip, two segments of data
had identifiable ADCP ensembles. Of these two segments, one had data
measured in deep water.
