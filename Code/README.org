* ~adcp_master~

The outermost function, called directly by the user. Just give it a cruise name
and watch it go!

Calls:
- ~config_cruise~
- ~config_setup~
- ~proc_all_deployments~

** ~config_cruise~
Locate and run the cruise-specific configuration file that initializes cruise
and deployment options.

** ~config_setup~
Take the cruise-specific configuration information and create a config structure
that contains paths to files and directories that will be used during
processing. Any unspecified options default to those specified in
- ~config_defaults()~.

Calls:
- ~fill_defaults~
- ~config_defaults~
- ~ross_post_setup~

** ~proc_all_deployments~
A simple wrapper around ~proc_deployment~ for processing all deployments
from all kayaks.

Calls:
- ~proc_deployment~

* ~proc_deployment~

The main processing function that works on one deployment at a time. At a high
level, this will:

- Initialize the processing log file
- Load or create ~.mat~ files containing raw data
- Process ADCP data
  - Trim data
  - Rotate to Earth coordinates
  - Remove vessel velocity
  - Apply trip- and deployment-specific filtering & additional processing
- Save the final processed data structure to a file
- Create figures

Calls:
- ~load_adcp~
- ~load_gps~
- ~ross_proc_gps~
- ~adcp_trim_data~
- deployment-specific pre-rotation function
- earth coordinate rotation function
- deployment-specific post-rotation function
- ~adcp_filter~
- ~ross_figures~
  
Many of these function are self-explainatory. Some of these live in the
~ocean_tools~ repository rather than the main ROSS repository.

* Creating Deployments

Deployments are set up in the cruise-specific configuration file, e.g.
[[./leconte_2017_sep/config_leconte_2017_sep.m][config_leconte_2017_sep.m]]. In this file, I've created multiple levels of options
to fall back on by using ~fill_defaults~ at a cruise-wide and per-kayak
level. The final outputs of a cruise config file are:

- cruise
  - A structure with two fields. The "name" field contains the cruise name, and
    the "kayaks" field contains a cell array of kayak names.
- deployments
  - A cell array with a deployment structure for each kayak. The entries in this
    array should correspond to the names in the cruise structure.

A kayak's deployment structure has an entry for each deployment to be processed.
An easy way to incrementally add deployments is to increment a deployment index
each time a deployment is added to the structure. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC matlab
  dep = dep+1;
  swankie(dep).name      = 'swankie_deployment_20170913132345';
  swankie(dep).dirs.raw  = 'deployment_20170913132345';
  swankie(dep).tlim = datenum([...
      '13-Sep-2017 14:03:47';
      '13-Sep-2017 17:01:19']);
#+END_SRC

The above code block appends a deployment to Swankie's deployment structure.
Below is a list of all deployment options. These can be specified
per-deployment, or as default options to be filled in using
~fill_defaults~.

Some options are better used as defaults than others - the deployment name, for
example, should not have a default value, while the adcp load function might be
the same across all deployments for a given cruise or kayak. In the previous
example, only the deployment's name, time limits, and raw data directories were
directly specified. Other options were filled as kayak defaults, cruise
defaults, or global defaults (in that order).
